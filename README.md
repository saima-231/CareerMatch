Project Description:

CareerMatch is a website that helps students find internships and lets companies post them. It makes applying for internships easier because everything is in one place for both students and companies. 

Students can search for internships, apply, and see where their application stands. 

Companies can handle their internship postings and look at applications. 
This project fixes the problem of internship info being all over the place and tracking applications by hand, which saves students and companies time and energy.
Key Features:

Student Features: Register and login, browse available internships, apply for internships, and track application status (Pending, Accepted, Rejected).

Company Features: Register and login, CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) for internship postings, and view/manage submitted student applications.

Admin/Oversight Features: Simple administrative dashboard for system monitoring (viewing all registered students, companies, and application data).
